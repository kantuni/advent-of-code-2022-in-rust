# Advent of Code 2022 (in Rust!)

Hi! üëã [Here are my solutions](https://github.com/treuille/advent-of-code-2022-in-rust/tree/main/src/bin) for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

My goals were:

* Each solution should be **clear, short, idiomatic, and fun to read!**
* Each solution should **share as much code as possible between parts A and B** to shed light on the underlying joint structure of the problems.
* All solutions run quickly -- under 500ms on my linux box -- combining both parts A and B together.

Enjoy! ‚ù§Ô∏è
